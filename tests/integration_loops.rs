//! Integration tests for loop edge behavior.
//!
//! NOTE: The LoopEdge struct, evaluate_loop_edges function, and Task.loops_to
//! field have been removed. Loop functionality is now handled through
//! structural cycles (after edges + CycleConfig).
//! All loop-edge-specific tests have been removed.
